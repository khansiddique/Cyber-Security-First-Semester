RSA Algorithm is the example for Public Key Encryption algorithm.
Here we are supposed to find two keys 
1) Public Key which is used at encryption
2) Private Key which is used at decryption
step 1: Select two large Primes P , Q
Step 2: Calculate n=P*Q & O(n) = (P-1)*(Q-1)
Step 3: Assume e and d (Public and Private Key).
Step 4: Encrypt the Plain Text using Public Key e.
Step 5: Decrypt the Cipher Text using Private Key d.
example:
M=5, P=3, Q=11
here pi(n)=2*10=20
e=7

we can assume d as 3 

d*e mod pi(n) =1
3*7 mod 20 =1

d=3

Encryption
C=M(power e) mod n
C=5(POWER 7) mod 33
C=14

Decryption
M=C(POWER d) mod n
M=14(POWER 3) mod 33
M=5.

Hope your doubt has been clarified.?
